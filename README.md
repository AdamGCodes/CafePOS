# ☕ Cafe in the Park POS

A simple Point-of-Sale (POS) interface built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This was my **first ever solo JavaScript project** — created around five years ago as I began learning to code.

## 🧠 About This Project

This app simulates a real-world POS terminal you might find in a local café. It lets staff:

- Select a table number  
- Choose items from a visual menu  
- Customize order options  
- Add multiple items to an order  
- Track a running subtotal  
- Simulate payments via card, cash, or discount code  
- Reset or clear orders as needed

All logic is handled using **vanilla JavaScript**, and layout/styling is done with **Bootstrap** and custom CSS.

## 🪞 Reflection

I’ll be honest — parts of this code now make me cringe. It’s verbose. It repeats itself. It does some wild things with arrays and DOM manipulation. But it also marks a **huge personal milestone**.

This was the first time I took an idea from concept to working app by myself. I remember the feeling when it all came together and the buttons *actually worked*. It felt like magic.

It’s important to me to **keep this live**. Not as a showcase of best practices, but as a **reminder of how far I’ve come** — and how proud I was at the time.
